I have implemented the assignment using Express as the backend framework. This README outlines the details for the Blog API with Comments, a part of the GenY Club assignment for both 1st and 2nd-year web development students. In this project, you will create a blog API that allows users to perform CRUD operations on blog posts and add comments to these posts, ensuring that only authorized users can access the system. You can choose between JWT or GoogleAuth for user authentication.
